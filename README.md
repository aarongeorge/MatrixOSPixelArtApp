# MatrixOS Pixel Art Application

This is a basic application for creating pixel art on the Mystrix

## Usage
1. When the app loads, press the middle button for a colour picker to appear
2. Tap the colour you want to use, then tap any pad to change it to that colour
3. Press the middle button again to hide the picker if you want to colour the top row
4. The touchstrip underglow also works :)
