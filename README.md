# MatrixOS Pixel Art Application

This is a basic application for creating pixel art on the Mystrix

## Usage
1. When the app loads, you will see a colour picker in the top row
2. Tap the colour you want to use, then tap any pad to change it to that colour
3. Press the middle button again to hide the picker if you want to colour the top row (press it again to make it appear)
4. The touchstrip underglow also works :)
